the prophecy is true  
we must protect the realm  
it’s not over yet  
the darkness is spreading  
I will not give up hope  
we fight for the light  
you are the chosen one  
this is our destiny  
the balance must be restored  
we have to seal the gate  
by the light of the moon  
the stars will guide us  
the old magic still lives  
we stand together as one  
no force can stop us now  
evil will not prevail  
our world depends on it  
the time of heroes has come  
the end of darkness begins tonight  
we have waited for this day  
the gods will judge us all  
may the light protect you  
we cannot run from fate  
this war has only begun  
our destiny is written in the stars  
the kingdom will rise again  
you have my sword and my loyalty  
we are stronger together  
I will stand by your side  
no matter what happens next  
the fire inside will never die  
the shadows are moving closer  
I can feel their presence  
this power is beyond our control  
we must destroy the source  
if we fail, the world will fall  
I won’t let that happen  
the gate must never be opened  
they are coming through the portal  
we have to close it now  
prepare the defenses immediately  
protect the civilians and the children  
hold the line until dawn  
they can’t hold us forever  
we’ll fight until the last breath  
the ancient power awakens once more  
only one can wield the blade  
the chosen one has returned  
I was born for this battle  
I’ll give my life for the realm  
the dragons have returned to the skies  
the mountains are trembling again  
magic flows through everything  
the spell is breaking apart  
the seal is weakening  
we have no time to waste  
gather the council at once  
the fate of all worlds depends on us  
we need to reach the temple before sunrise  
the ancient runes have been activated  
the spirits are calling your name  
the truth lies beyond the gate  
don’t look into the void  
whatever happens, don’t lose hope  
I’ll hold them off as long as I can  
save yourselves, go now  
remember what I taught you  
the legend said this day would come  
it’s not the end, it’s the beginning  
we were never meant to survive  
our sacrifice will not be forgotten  
the light will return someday  
as long as we remember who we are  
the stars will watch over us  
they’re already here  
the invasion has begun  
prepare the ship for jump  
set coordinates for the outer rim  
we’re losing power in sector seven  
the reactor is overheating  
reroute energy to the shields  
hull integrity dropping fast  
get us out of here  
we can’t take another hit  
the captain is down  
someone has to take command  
we have contact with an unknown vessel  
open a channel, let’s talk to them  
this signal isn’t from our galaxy  
it’s coming from deep space  
the system is failing, we’re out of time  
prepare for emergency landing  
brace for impact  
initiate self-destruct sequence  
there’s no other way  
the AI has gone rogue  
it’s controlling the entire station  
we need to shut it down  
override the core manually  
the code isn’t working  
try bypassing the firewall  
I’m locked out of the system  
they’ve taken control of communications  
we’re completely cut off  
I can’t believe they did this  
how long have they been watching us  
the experiment went wrong  
we created something we can’t destroy  
it’s evolving faster than expected  
it’s learning from us  
we’re the ones being studied  
the colony has gone silent  
there’s no sign of life anywhere  
something’s hiding out there  
don’t open that door  
whatever you do, stay quiet  
we’re not alone anymore  
I saw it moving in the dark  
we have to leave this planet now  
there’s nowhere left to run  
this place is a graveyard  
turn off the lights, they can see us  
I can hear them whispering  
it’s inside the ship  
get to the escape pods now  
they’re blocking the exit  
we’re trapped inside  
seal the bulkheads  
the oxygen levels are dropping  
we have to reach the bridge  
I’ll distract them, go!  
you’re not coming back, are you  
someone has to stay behind  
it’s been an honor serving with you  
tell my family I love them  
launch the pods before it’s too late  
mission control, do you read me  
signal lost, we’ve lost connection  
this isn’t over yet  
the universe won’t forgive us  
the stars are dying one by one  
we need to find a new world  
we’ve been traveling for centuries  
the crew’s losing hope  
our supplies won’t last much longer  
we can’t turn back now  
the AI says the planet is habitable  
prepare for atmospheric entry  
we’re finally home  
this is where it all began  
but something feels wrong here  
there’s something beneath the surface  
I think we’ve been here before  
it’s repeating, just like the simulation  
time itself is collapsing  
the portal is destabilizing reality  
we can’t let it spread further  
shut it down before it’s too late  
I’m losing control of the energy field  
it’s feeding off my life force  
cut the link, now  
you’ll die if you stay connected  
then so be it, this is my choice  
I was meant to end it  
tell them I’m sorry  
the universe deserves another chance  
don’t let my sacrifice be in vain  
the light returns to the cosmos  
the war among the stars is over  
peace has finally been restored  
the balance between worlds is complete  
a new age begins today  
the prophecy has been fulfilled  
and thus the cycle continues  
we will remember the fallen  
and honor their names forever  
until the stars fade from the sky  
and the last flame goes out  
hope will always remain  
because heroes never truly die  
we live on in the stories they tell  
in the hearts of those who remain  
the realm is safe again  
the light shines once more  
we’ve saved what we could  
and lost what we must  
but the journey never truly ends  
for there will always be another dawn  
and another shadow to face  
when darkness falls again  
we’ll rise once more
